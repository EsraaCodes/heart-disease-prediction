# Heart Disease Prediction

## Problem
This project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes using machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient medical information such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health-related features.  
It is used to train and evaluate a classification model.

## Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier (scikit-learn)

## Evaluation
The model achieved approximately **86% accuracy** on the training data and showed reasonable performance on the test set, indicating good generalization and no severe overfitting.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
It serves as a solid introductory project for supervised classification tasks.
